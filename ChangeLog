audio_burn 0.0.9
================
- explicitly drop privileges in all code paths after running cdrecord
- add --atapi command line option to support probing IDE cdrom devices
- add --atapi-dev=DEV command line option to support using a specific IDE
  cdrom device (where DEV=/dev/hdX)
- use explicit -tao option by default unless -dao is specified
- fixed a cdrecord/device probing parse bug that caused some devices to
  show up with the wrong bus,target,lun and label 
- fixed a crash bug when reading configuration files that are longer than
  expected due to not clearing the input buffer between reads
- fixed a general configuration parse bug


audio_burn 0.0.8
================
- added support for burning multiple copies of the same cd using the
  --copies=M or -C M command line options
- added configuration file support in libaudioburn.  audio_burn will now
  use the settings in the configuration file, but overwrites settings with
  command line arguments if there are conflicts.  settings can be written
  to a config file (${HOME}/.audioburnrc) by using the --saveconfig
  command line switch
- ignore all probed scsi devices that are not CD-ROM devices
- added a gracetime option to shorten the wait time before burning
- when the new --copies or -C option is used, set the gracetime
  automatically to 2 seconds (the smallest allowable gracetime)
- added support for enabling burn-free (buffer-underrun) mode if available
  using the --burnfree command line option
- removed TODO file from distribution
- report cd-devices as CD-ROM devices, rather than SCSI devices
- properly warn user if config file cannot be read on startup


audio_burn 0.0.7
================
- added CREDITS file to the distribution
- sets the default burn speed to be the fastest possible, instead of 1x
- added support for files with mixed case file extensions (e.g. Mp3)
- added support for m3u format playlists, in that the files in them are
  processed if one is specified on the command line
- added improved error handling and reporting in several places


audio_burn 0.0.6
================
- added a small delay in between io callbacks to make the output smoother
  during decoding/normalization stages
- properly check wav file headers to see if resampling is necessary; now
  does a direct wav file header read and does not rely on shell tool
  'file' since some versions did not properly report required information
- added session at once option (commonly referred to as disk-at-once) due
  to user request


audio_burn 0.0.5
================
- Properly check to make sure all specified songs can fit on CD
  (based on time) before decoding anything (rather than after)
- Added a --cdlength command line option for specifying longer or
  shorter target audio disc lengths.  74 minutes is the default.
- Minor cosmetic changes to output


audio_burn 0.0.4
================

- Crash bug fix when no cdrecorder is present
- Properly handle non-cd removable media being present and detect it as a
  non cd recording device (i.e. ignore non cd devices that show up as a
  scsi device according to cdrecord)
- Properly detect devices across multiple scsibuses (not multiple devices
  *per* scsibus, but rather *multiple* scsibuses)
- Cosmetic changes to program output


audio_burn 0.0.3
================

- Fixed the usage of the -s and -e options (now recognized properly)
- Now resamples wav files after generating them if they're not valid
- Fixed a bad pointer error when using the nocleantmp option
- Fixed broken parsing of multiple scsi devices (Robert Brown)
- Cosmetic changes to program output


audio_burn 0.0.2
================

- Replaced spaces with underscores when generating temporary files
- Fixed broken soft linking on valid input wav files by specifying
  full pathnames
- Added a "--nocleantmp" option to allow outputted wav files to not
  be deleted


audio_burn 0.0.1
================

- Initial public release of audio_burn
